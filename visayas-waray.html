      <h2>History of the Waray</h2>
      <p>
        The Waray people, inhabiting the islands of Samar, Leyte, and Biliran in the Eastern Visayas, descend from Austronesian-speaking seafarers who settled the archipelago during the Iron Age. Before Spanish colonization, the Waray had established complex socio-political systems and engaged in trade with Chinese, Bornean, and Malay merchants. Their pre-colonial culture included a belief in numerous deities or diwata, reflecting a rich mythology. Early accounts from Magellan's expedition in 1521 mark the first encounter between Europeans and the Waray people of Samar. While among the first to be Christianized, the Waray have also retained many indigenous traditions, blending them with Catholic practices. Known for their bravery and often described with the saying "Waray never backs down from a fight," their history is one of a vibrant seafaring culture that adapted to external influences while maintaining a strong sense of identity rooted in their language and traditions.   </p>

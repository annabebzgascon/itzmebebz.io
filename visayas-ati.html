      <h2>History of the Ati</h2>
      <p>
        The Ati people are a Negrito ethnic group and are considered the original inhabitants of Panay Island and parts of Negros and Boracay in the Visayas. Their history in the Philippines dates back tens of thousands of years, with genetic evidence linking them to the earliest human migrations to the archipelago via land bridges from Borneo. Oral traditions, such as the legend of the ten Bornean datus and the Maragtas, speak of their interactions with later Malay settlers, where they are depicted as bartering their land for gifts.  </p>
    <p>During the Spanish colonial period, the Ati had contact with conquistadors and were utilized in the colonization efforts. Despite increasing integration with mainstream Filipino society, particularly in areas like Boracay, where they faced displacement due to tourism, the Ati have strived to maintain their distinct cultural identity, including their own language (Inati), traditional animistic beliefs (though many have adopted Christianity), and practices like herbal medicine. The Ati-Atihan festival in Aklan, while now a vibrant religious celebration honoring the Santo Ni√±o, is also said to commemorate the early interactions between the Ati and the Malay settlers. Today, the Ati continue to advocate for their ancestral land rights and the preservation of their unique heritage as one of the Philippines' oldest peoples.</p>

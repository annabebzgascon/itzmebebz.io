      <h2>History of the Tagbanua</h2>
      <p>
        The Tagbanua people, primarily residing in central and northern Palawan, are considered one of the oldest indigenous groups in the Philippines, with some researchers suggesting a connection to the Tabon Man. Their history is marked by a long tradition of self-sufficiency and a close relationship with nature, evident in their traditional livelihoods of fishing, farming, and gathering forest products. Notably, the Tagbanua possess their own ancient writing system, a testament to their rich cultural heritage. While they experienced contact with early traders and later with Spanish and American presence, their remote settlements allowed them to maintain many of their unique customs and beliefs, including a deep respect for the spirits inhabiting the natural world. Today, the Tagbanua continue to strive to protect their ancestral domains and preserve their distinct cultural identity in the face of modernization and external pressures. </p>

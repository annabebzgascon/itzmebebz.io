      <h2>History of the Mandaya</h2>
      <p>
        The Mandaya people are an indigenous group primarily residing in the southeastern part of Mindanao, particularly in Davao Oriental and parts of Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Sur. Their name is believed to originate from "man" (man) and "daya" (upstream or interior), referring to their traditional settlements in the hinterlands and along river valleys. Historically, the Mandaya were known for their strong warrior traditions, intricate beadwork, and vibrant textiles, particularly their ikat weaving. They had a well-defined social structure with datus (chieftains) leading their communities. Their spiritual beliefs were deeply connected to nature, with reverence for spirits and ancestral figures. While they experienced interactions with other groups and external influences over time, the Mandaya have maintained a distinct cultural identity, continuing to practice their traditional arts, rituals, and customs in their ancestral domains.</p>

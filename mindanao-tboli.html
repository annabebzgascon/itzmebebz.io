      <h2>History of the T'boli</h2>
      <p>
        The T'boli people, an indigenous group residing in the highlands of Southwestern Mindanao, particularly around Lake Sebu in South Cotabato, have a history marked by resilience and a deep connection to their ancestral lands. Anthropological evidence suggests their Austronesian roots, with a past where they likely inhabited coastal areas and fertile valleys before being gradually pushed inland by later migrations, possibly including the advent of Islam in the region around the 14th century. The mountainous terrain provided a degree of isolation, allowing them to preserve their unique culture and traditions relatively undisturbed. Their history is intertwined with their sophisticated craftsmanship, particularly their intricate t'nalak weaving, and a rich animistic belief system that reveres nature spirits. Despite increasing contact with the outside world in more recent times, the T'boli continue to uphold their distinct cultural identity and advocate for the preservation of their ancestral domains. </p>

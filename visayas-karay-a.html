      <h2>History of the Karay-a</h2>
      <p>
        The Karay-a people are an indigenous group primarily found in the central part of Panay Island, particularly in the province of Antique, Philippines. Their history is intertwined with the broader narrative of early settlements in Panay and their interactions with other indigenous groups like the Ati. Oral traditions and archaeological evidence suggest a long presence in the region, with a way of life traditionally centered around agriculture, particularly rice cultivation in the fertile plains of Antique. </p>
    <p>While Panay was among the first islands to be encountered by the Spanish, the mountainous interior where many Karay-a communities resided provided a degree of natural protection, allowing them to maintain aspects of their traditional culture and social structures. Their history includes the development of unique customs, traditions, and a distinct dialect of Kinaray-a. Over time, they have adapted to the changing socio-political landscape while striving to preserve their cultural heritage and connection to their ancestral lands in Antique. Today, the Karay-a people continue to be a vibrant part of the cultural diversity of Panay Island.</p>

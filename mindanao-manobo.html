      <h2>History of the Manobo</h2>
      <p>
        The Manobo people are a major indigenous group in Mindanao, Philippines, with a history tracing back to the early Malay peoples who migrated to the islands of Southeast Asia. The term "Manobo" itself can mean "people" or "person." They are not a single unified tribe but rather a cluster of closely related groups who speak languages belonging to the Manobo language family. These groups, including the Cotabato Manobo, Agusan Manobo, and many others, have historically inhabited the vast interior of Mindanao, from Sarangani Island up to the provinces of Agusan del Sur, Davao, Bukidnon, and North and South Cotabato. </p>
    <p>heir history is characterized by a deep connection to the land and a traditional way of life centered around agriculture, hunting, and fishing. While they share linguistic and some cultural similarities, geographical separation has led to the development of distinct dialects and unique customs among the various Manobo subgroups. Traditional Manobo society often features a patriarchal structure with datus (chieftains) who hold leadership roles. Their rich cultural heritage includes intricate beadwork, weaving, music, and spiritual beliefs centered on a supreme being and various nature spirits. Like other indigenous groups in Mindanao, the Manobo have faced challenges related to land rights, modernization, and the preservation of their cultural identity.</p>

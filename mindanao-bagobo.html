      <h2>History of the Bagobo</h2>
      <p>
        The Bagobo people are one of the largest indigenous groups in Southern Mindanao, Philippines, with their ancestral lands traditionally 
        located around Mount Apo and the Davao Gulf. The name "Bagobo" is said to derive from "bago" (new) and "obo" (growth). Historically, they 
        were a nomadic tribe, traversing the forests and settling in areas abundant with hunting grounds. The Bagobo are composed of three main subgroups:
         the Tagabawa, the Klata (or Guiangan), and the Ubo, each with slight variations in their dialects, customs, and attire. </p>
   <p>Their history is marked by a strong social structure led by chieftains ("Matanum") and councils of elders. They were known for their intricate craftsmanship, producing fine textiles, clothing 
    heavily adorned with colorful beadwork and embroidery, as well as weapons and brassware using the lost-wax casting process. While their traditional way of life has been influenced by external factors, many Bagobo people continue to uphold their cultural heritage and traditions, deeply connected to their ancestral lands around the sacred Mount Apo.</p>

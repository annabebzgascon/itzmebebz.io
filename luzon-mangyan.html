      <h2>History of the Mangyan</h2>
      <p>
        The Mangyan peoples are a diverse group of indigenous tribes inhabiting the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, each with their own distinct languages, customs, and histories. Unlike many other indigenous groups in the Philippines, the Mangyan did not experience intense direct colonization, which allowed them to preserve many aspects of their traditional ways of life. Their history is characterized by a long-standing reliance on agriculture, hunting, and gathering in the mountainous interior of Mindoro. They developed unique writing systems, such as the Ambahan and Surat Mangyan scripts, which are still used today to record poetry and traditional knowledge. Over time, they have faced pressures from deforestation, land encroachment, and integration with lowland communities, leading to displacement and challenges in maintaining their cultural identities and ancestral domains. Despite these pressures, the Mangyan continue to strive to preserve their rich cultural heritage, languages, and traditional practices, representing a significant part of the Philippines' indigenous history and cultural diversity. </p>

      <h2>History of the Lumad</h2>
      <p>
        The term "Lumad" is a collective term that encompasses various indigenous groups of Mindanao, Philippines, adopted in 1986 to distinguish them from Moro and Christian populations. Their history is characterized by a long presence on the island, predating both Islam and Christianity. These diverse communities, including groups like the Manobo, Bagobo, Higaonon, and many others, traditionally inhabited the hinterlands, forests, and coastal areas, maintaining distinct social structures, spiritual beliefs, and cultural practices deeply rooted in their ancestral lands.   </p>
    <p>While Mindanao experienced trade and some external influences before the Spanish era, the Lumad communities largely retained their autonomy due to their inland settlements. The Spanish colonial period saw attempts at subjugation and conversion, but many Lumad groups resisted and maintained their traditional ways of life. In the 20th century, increased migration and development pressures led to challenges in preserving their ancestral domains and cultural heritage. Today, the Lumad continue to advocate for their rights, cultural preservation, and self-determination within Mindanao.</p>

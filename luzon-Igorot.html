      <h2>History of the Igorot</h2>
      <p>
        The term "Igorot" is an umbrella term encompassing various indigenous ethnic groups inhabiting the mountainous Cordillera region of Northern Luzon, Philippines. Their history is marked by a strong tradition of independence and self-governance, largely due to the rugged terrain that limited Spanish colonial influence. Unlike many lowland communities, the Igorot peoples, including groups like the Ifugao, Bontoc, Kalinga, Apayao, and Benguet, maintained their unique social structures, beliefs, and practices, such as elaborate rice cultivation techniques (like the Ifugao Rice Terraces), intricate weaving, metalworking, and distinct legal and political systems. While facing pressures from modernization and integration in the 20th century, the Igorot have actively worked to preserve their rich cultural heritage and assert their rights to ancestral domains, making their history a compelling narrative of resilience, cultural continuity, and the assertion of indigenous identity within the broader Philippine context.  </p>

      <h2>History of the Higaonon</h2>
      <p>
        The Higaonon tribe, whose name translates to "people of the living mountains," are an indigenous group residing in the mountainous regions of north-central Mindanao, Philippines. Their history is marked by a long-standing presence in these ancestral domains, predating Spanish colonization. Due to their remote settlements, they largely maintained their self-determination and traditional way of life, which is deeply connected to the forests and natural resources around them. Oral traditions and customs have been vital in preserving their history and cultural identity across generations. While facing modern influences and challenges to their ancestral lands, the Higaonon people continue to uphold their unique heritage and strive for the recognition and protection of their rights. </p>
